This is a simple disassembler for the Intel 8080 microprocessor. It
reads a binary file specified on the command line and produces a
disassembly. It requires Python 3. It has been tested on Linux but
should work on any platform that supports Python. See the source code
for more details.

Also available is a version that disassembles code for the Z80
microprocessor. It is not yet complete.

The files ex1.bin, ex2.bin, and ex3.bin are some example binary files
that can be used to test the disassembler.

usage: disasm8080.py [-h] [-n] [-u] [-a ADDRESS] [-f {1,2,3,4}] filename

positional arguments:
  filename              Binary file to disassemble

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -n, --nolist          Don't list instruction bytes (make output suitable for
                        assembler)
  -u, --uppercase       Use uppercase for mnemonics
  -a ADDRESS, --address ADDRESS
                        Specify decimal starting address (defaults to 0)
  -f {1,2,3,4}, --format {1,2,3,4}
                        Use number format: 1=$1234 2=1234h 3=1234 4=177777
                        (default 1)
