Zmon is a small machine language monitor program for Intel 8080
computers from Appendix B of the book "The Microcomputer Builder's
Bible" by Chris Johnston.

This version is based on the original listing in the book, adapted to
build with the AS macro assembler and run on the Briel Altair 8800
computer.
